# CS1342_ZybookReport


It is a small program that helps TAs in CS1342 organize the Zybook report they downloaded. (Version:1.0)

#Instruction:

1: Fill your NameList.csv in the cmake-build-debug folder with all the students' names in your lab section.
(IMPORTANT!!!: Students' name should be the same as what in the zybook report. The case is not sensitive.)

2: Put all the zybook reports you downloaded into the src folder in cmake-build-debug.

3: When you run the code, you will need to type in the output file name and your Lab Section number.

4: After you created an output file, you need to open it and add Class-section manually if it says "need a section". That's because some report doesn't have a Class section column.

5: In the output file, you will also need to add a "comment" column to make comments for students' lab.
